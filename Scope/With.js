/***
 * The other frowned-upon (and now deprecated!) feature in JavaScript
that cheats lexical scope is the with keyword. There are multiple valid
ways that with can be explained, but I will choose here to explain it
from the perspective of how it interacts with and affects lexical scope.
with is typically explained as a shorthand for making multiple property
references against an object without repeating the object reference
itself each time.

While the eval(..) function can modify existing lexical scope if it
takes a string of code with one or more declarations in it, the with
statement actually creates a whole new lexical scope out of thin air, from
the object you pass to it.

Compiler asks Scope to see if a variable a
already exists for that particular scope collection. If so, Compiler
ignores this declaration and moves on. Otherwise, Compiler asks
Scope to declare a new variable called a for that scope collection.
