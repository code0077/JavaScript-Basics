 * that variable and function declarations are “moved” from where they
appear in the flow of the code to the top of the code. This gives rise to
the name hoisting.

Only the declarations themselves are hoisted, while any assignments
or other executable logic are left in place. If hoisting
were to re-arrange the executable logic of our code, that
could wreak havoc.
