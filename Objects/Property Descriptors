var myObject = {
 a: 2
};
Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor( myObject, "a" );
// {
// value: 2,
// writable: true,
// enumerable: true,
// configurable: true
// }
As you can see, the property descriptor (called a “data descriptor” since
it’s only for holding a data value) for our normal object property a is
much more than just its value of 2. It includes three other character‐
istics: writable, enumerable, and configurable.
While we can see what the default values for the property descriptor
characteristics are when we create a normal property, we can use Ob
ject.defineProperty(..) to add a new property, or modify an ex‐
isting one (if it’s configurable!), with the desired characteristics.
For example:
var myObject = {};
Object.defineProperty( myObject, "a", {
 value: 2,
 writable: true,
 configurable: true,
 enumerable: true
} );
myObject.a; // 2
Using defineProperty(..), we added the plain, normal a property
to myObject in a manually explicit way. However, you generally wouldn’t use this manual approach unless you wanted to modify one
of the descriptor characteristics from its normal behavior.
