Objects are the general building block upon which much of JS is built.
They are one of the six primary types (called “language types” in the
specification) in JS:
• string
• number
• boolean
• null
• undefined
• object

Built-in Objects
There are several other object subtypes, usually referred to as built-in
objects. For some of them, their names seem to imply they are directly
related to their simple primitive counterparts, but in fact, their rela‐
tionship is more complicated, which we’ll explore shortly.
• String
• Number
• Boolean
• Object
• Function
• Array
• Date
• RegExp
• Error


var strPrimitive = "I am a string";
typeof strPrimitive; // "string"
strPrimitive instanceof String; // false
var strObject = new String( "I am a string" );
typeof strObject; // "object"
strObject instanceof String; // true
